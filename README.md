# Date Folders

Yeah ok... well, have you ever had a folder filled with images? Do you like the way many photo apps structure them like:
```
    .
    └── 2017
        └── 01
            └── IMG0001.DNG
        └── 05
            └── IMG0002.DNG
```
Well I do! But I hate being dependant on a friggin' app to do it when all I wanna do is to quickly structure my files before sending them to my backup location.

Just cd into the flat boring folder with shitloads of files and hit `dfold`. Your files will be moved into the folder structure based on its birthdate.

Enjoy?
